perfect question 👏 — once your SLM finishes training, you’ve basically got a tiny local language model sitting in memory.
now you can generate text, save it, reload it, or fine-tune further.
here’s the complete post-training workflow explained step-by-step 👇


---

🧠 1️⃣ understand what just happened

after training, the script already prints:

=== SAMPLE ===
To be or not to be, the mind to suffer...
==============

that’s the model generating text conditioned on the --seed string.

so you’ve already seen it work — that’s a forward pass using its learned weights.


---

💾 2️⃣ save the trained model

add this near the end of slm.py (just above if __name__ == "__main__":)

def save_model(model, path="slm.pth"):
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), path)
    print(f"Model saved to {path}")

then after training:

save_model(model)

this saves the trained weights (~100–200 KB) locally.


---

🔄 3️⃣ load it later for generation

create a small script generate.py:

import torch
from slm import TinyGPT, CharData, load_text

device = "cpu"
text = load_text()
data = CharData(text)

model = TinyGPT(vocab_size=data.vocab_size)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("slm.pth", map_location=device))
model.eval()

seed = "Audit"
inp = data.encode(seed).unsqueeze(0)
out = model.generate(inp.to(device), max_new_tokens=300)
print(data.decode(out[0].tolist()))

run:

python generate.py

✅ this reuses your trained weights and instantly generates new text without retraining.


---

🧪 4️⃣ experiment further

you can now:

change corpus (replace input.txt and retrain)

tune hyperparameters, e.g.

python slm.py --train-steps 1000 --n-layer 3 --n-head 4

save checkpoints after each epoch if you want multiple versions

plot training loss (log and visualize over steps)



---

⚡ 5️⃣ optional: use interactively

add a short prompt loop inside generate.py:

while True:
    seed = input("You: ")
    if seed.lower() in ["quit", "exit"]:
        break
    out = model.generate(data.encode(seed).unsqueeze(0), max_new_tokens=150)
    print("Model:", data.decode(out[0].tolist()))

now you have your own chat-like mini LLM running 100% offline 🧩

would you like me to show how to extend this so it accepts multi-sentence prompts (like a tiny conversation memory or audit Q&A)?



















RAG Orchestration Log Validation Guide — Clickyyy

This document provides detailed guidelines for validating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) orchestration logs in Clickyyy, focusing on Data Collection stages across environments — Development, Pre-Production, and Production.

Each request initiated via the Clickyyy UI or API triggers a Query Orchestration Flow, which internally logs various RAG pipeline stages (e.g., Retrieval, Augmentation, Generation, Ranking). These stages are correlated through a unique Interaction ID, captured during the Data Collection process.

This document describes how to:

Capture the Interaction ID from the Query endpoint response in the Network tab.

Use the Interaction ID to locate the corresponding Data Collection logs in Splunk.

Verify the RAG stage progression and ensure the full orchestration pipeline is being logged consistently across environments.



---

2. Objective

The primary objective of this procedure is to:

Verify that data collection and RAG stages are properly logged under a unique Interaction ID.

Ensure traceability of each Clickyyy query from the UI trigger to downstream orchestration components.

Confirm end-to-end logging parity across all environments (Dev, Preprod, Prod).

Facilitate debugging, observability, and RCA for issues related to orchestration and data collection.



---

3. Environments

Environment        Splunk Instance        Purpose

Development (DEV)        Splunk QA        For initial testing and local orchestration validation.
Pre-Production (PREPROD)        Splunk QA        For UAT and staging-level verification before go-live.
Production (PROD)        Splunk PROD        For live observability, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring.



---

4. Key Concepts

Interaction ID

A unique UUID generated for each query orchestration request.

It acts as a correlation identifier to trace all sub-events (retrieval, ranking, summarization, etc.) within the orchestration lifecycle.


RAG Orchestration Flow

A multi-stage process within Clickyyy that includes:

1. Query Initialization – Input from the UI or API is received.


2. Data Collection – Relevant content is retrieved from connected sources.


3. Contextual Augmentation – Retrieved results are ranked and embedded.


4. Response Generation – Final output is produced using LLMs.


5. Response Dispatch – Output is sent back to the user.



Each of these stages logs events with the same Interaction ID for full traceability.


---

5. Pre-Requisites

Valid access to Splunk QA and Production instances.

Access to Clickyyy UI or API endpoints in all environments.

Knowledge of the Query endpoint path (typically /query or /data-collection).

Browser with Developer Tools → Network Tab (Chrome recommended).



---

6. Steps for Verification

Step 1: Trigger a Query

1. Log in to the Clickyyy UI in the desired environment.


2. Enter a query that triggers the RAG orchestration (for example:
“Show documents related to invoice processing”).


3. Wait until the response is returned to the UI.




---

Do you want me to include the screenshots section (where you’ll attach UI and Splunk screenshots) next, formatted as a separate numbered section (e.g., “7. Evidence & Screenshots”)?
I can also add placeholders and captions like:

> “Attach Screenshot 1: Query endpoint Network tab showing Interaction ID”
“Attach Screenshot 2: Splunk log entry for the same Interaction ID (Dev)”



Would you like me to add that?
